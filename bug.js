The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has fully loaded.  This is especially common when using asynchronous functions like `getDoc()` or `onSnapshot()`. For example:

```javascript
const docRef = doc(db, "collection", "docId");
const docSnap = await getDoc(docRef);
console.log(docSnap.data().someField); // Error if data() is not loaded yet
```
This will throw an error if `someField` doesn't exist or if `data()` is empty, which can easily happen if the asynchronous `getDoc` call hasn't fully completed.
